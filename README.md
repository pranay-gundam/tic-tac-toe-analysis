# tic-tac-toe-analysis
Some stuff I was curious about when I was bored...

Tic-Tac-Toe is a very solved game such that even elementary school kids with some free time can identify the optimal winning and tying algorithms. It's easy to hard code
a bot to find the optimal solution but I was interested in other features of the game. I made a simple expected value based bot to see what moves it will play. There is
still some more work to be done in terms of if there is an error in the code or if an expected value based approach doesn't lead to the optimal algorithm. There is also
a test done to see the win rate of the first playing and second playing player if they were to play random moves.

required packages:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
